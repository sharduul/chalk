Let's talk about passive income! And get you start making another stream of income.

This post was comprehensively help you make money no matter what you do 365 days a year. Just read every line with utmost attention.

But, first, do you know why do you need passive income in the first place?

If you are reading this chances are you are trading "something" in exchange of money. That something can be time, knowledge, energy for most of us. That makes it an active income.

Don't get me wrong, it is not bad at all. In face, most us start from that point.

But the problem is if you start dedicating that "something" - you won't make any money at all. If tomorrow you stop going to your 9-5 job you will have absolutely zero income from that point.

Basically, there is a limitation on how much you invest that "something". For instance, there is only so much time in a day that you could work.

This post is my attempt to inspire you to move above it. Motivate you to reach to a point where you ca sit at home on a Wednesday afternoon - watching TV, play with your kids and still be sure that money will make it to your bank that day.

Or take a month long vacation and still not worry about money. Because you know it is being generated passively.

If I have got you to this point, I am sure you would like to see how could you get started.

Let's dive into that, shall we?

> I make $5450 every month passively. On top of my day job. That is $180 per day for doing almost nothing.

My main sources of this passive income are as follows.

## Dividends

Every month, I earn about \$800 through dividends alone.

I have invested in sticks, bonds, and ETFs. And, the amount is the average monthly I make from dividends that I earn just by holding those investments.

Not all of them are dividend stocks. Some of them are growth stocks, whose value is expected to grow exponentially over the decade. So, image the compound interest that I get on them.

And the dividends I earn gets re-invested in the stocks. Giving additional boost to the compound interest that I earn on my investments.

If you want to start investing today, I recommend these two platforms:

Even if you have a brokerage account and want to move to a no-fees broker, [M1 Finance - Comprehensive Review](http://ngninja.com/posts/m1-finance-review-2019) is the best investment platform out there.

## Rental Property

Every month, I earn about \$1500 through my rental properties.

I recently started investing in real estate. And, I own one rental property at the time of writing this article. The \$1500 is the profit I earn after cutting the parts which goes to mortgage, home insurance, and maintenance. I will do an in-depth review if you guys need more information on how to start with real estate investments.

## Affiliate Marketing

Every month, I earn about \$450 through my rental properties.

I am an affiliate to various products. Both physical and digital. Do note, that I promote only those products which I use and I am a genuine fan of. These consists of tech products, digital products, and financial platforms.

Best ones I can recommend you to check our are:

#### [Acorns](http://bit.ly/acornFree)<br/> - invest your spare change and create another stream of passive income.

## Selling online courses

Every month, I earn about \$650 through selling online courses.

This is rapidly becoming the main stream of income at Ninja Academy. This is the amount we make through passive income from all the sells that we make.

We have created online notes for Software Engineers to help them land their dream jobs. If you are one of those, I'd recommend checking our the testimonials on how we have helped so many students get humongous salaries at their dream jobs.

Check out the testimonials [here](https://mx84n.weblium.site).

## Graphic Designing

Every month, I earn about $350 through graphic design projects.

We are slowly ramping up with design gigs. We very recently started accepting design gigs after continuos requests from our existing clients.

Main point to note here is, we also outsource some of the gigs to our trusted partners. Its a win-win situation!

## Dropshipping

My monthly **profits** through the dropshipping business is around $2500.

I have partnered with one of my friend on this. So, we split the profits between us. 

Dropshipping is an amazing and a legit business model you guys should look into if you are looking for a new business idea.  If you are not sure what dropshipping is, [read this awesome article on what is dropshipping](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping/understanding-dropshipping).

## Take a lon...nng break

The above mentioned sources are just a tip of an infinitely sized ice-burg of passive income streams. Trust me, sky is the limit.

Imagine what you could do with all that saved time. Take a break. Go on a vacation. And, still make $180 per day for doing nothing at all!

That is the freedom that gives me high. Keeps me going.

## Investor mindset 

This doesn't happen overnight. It takes time and super hard work to build multiple streams of income.

But, more importantly this needs an investor mindset rather than a spending mindset.

Every penny you get from your active job - you should invest it. Invest it on outsourcing jobs that sucks most of your time unnecessarily. Invest on gaining skills that will be useful for your side-gig. Don't be afraid to learn, or spend money on learning. Every lesson that you learn will be useful and payoff in the long run.

But, don't go wasting money on drinks multiple time a week, or something that does not really add any value to your life. Always think how could you invest that money in something that will give back to you multiples of it.


## Live life stress-free

And, you know what other great thing about this mindset is?

You get to live your life free. That too stress-free.

Let me explain.

You have all these passive income streams that make you a ton of money. With the mindset shift I proposed earlier - that money will pay for all your expenses. 

Now you don't have to worry going out of job. You don't have to worry about any emergency expenses. Your pockets will never be empty!

> You will start working because you enjoy it. Not because you need money to support your family.

And, don't get me wrong. This post is not about bragging about my passive income streams. Nor am I telling you to quit job because it sucks - no it does not! You need your active income job if you are just getting started. 

This article is more to inspire you. To get you started. To show you what is possible if you truly want to level up your life.
