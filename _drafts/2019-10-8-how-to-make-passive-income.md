Let's talk about passive income! And get you start making another stream of income.

This post was comprehensively help you make money no matter what you do 365 days a year. Just read every line with utmost attention.

But, first, do you know why do you need passive income in the first place?

If you are reading this chances are you are trading "something" in exchange of money. That something can be time, knowledge, energy for most of us. That makes it an active income.

Don't get me wrong, it is not bad at all. In face, most us start from that point.

But the problem is if you start dedicating that "something" - you won't make any money at all. If tomorrow you stop going to your 9-5 job you will have absolutely zero income from that point.

Basically, there is a limitation on how much you invest that "something". For instance, there is only so much time in a day that you could work.

This post is my attempt to inspire you to move above it. Motivate you to reach to a point where you ca sit at home on a Wednesday afternoon - watching TV, play with your kids and still be sure that money will make it to your bank that day.

Or take a month long vacation and still not worry about money. Because you know it is being generated passively.

If I have got you to this point, I am sure you would like to see how could you get started.

Let's dive into that, shall we?

> I make $5450 every month passively. On top of my day job. That is $180 per day for doing almost nothing.

My main sources of this passive income are as follows.

## Dividends

Every month, I earn about \$800 through dividends alone.

I have invested in sticks, bonds, and ETFs. And, the amount is the average monthly I make from dividends that I earn just by holding those investments.

Not all of them are dividend stocks. Some of them are growth stocks, whose value is expected to grow exponentially over the decade. So, image the compound interest that I get on them.

And the dividends I earn gets re-invested in the stocks. Giving additional boost to the compound interest that I earn on my investments.

If you want to start investing today, I recommend these two platforms:

Even if you have a brokerage account and want to move to a no-fees broker, [M1 Finance - Comprehensive Review](http://ngninja.com/posts/m1-finance-review-2019) is the best investment platform out there.

## Rental Property

Every month, I earn about \$1500 through my rental properties.

I recently started investing in real estate. And, I own one rental property at the time of writing this article. The \$1500 is the profit I earn after cutting the parts which goes to mortgage, home insurance, and maintenance. I will do an in-depth review if you guys need more information on how to start with real estate investments.

## Affiliate Marketing

Every month, I earn about \$450 through my rental properties.

I am an affiliate to various products. Both physical and digital. Do note, that I promote only those products which I use and I am a genuine fan of. These consists of tech products, digital products, and financial platforms.

Best ones I can recommend you to check our are:
