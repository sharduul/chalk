This post is dedicated to the best free investing app out there - M1 Finance. I will provide a super comprehensive review on the platform and help you decide whether or not this app is for you.

It is the most frequently asked review on this blog and on our investment channel<insta link to ninja>.


### The Best One Out There

Right off the bat, M1 Finance is super charged with a lot of features. It is better than any other similar apps out there. (ahem, Robinhood).

M1 Finance lets you invest in partial shares of individual stocks and ETFs. Let's be honest, not everyone has money to buy full stock of Amazon and Google. You need to a have ton of money to buy the whole stock.

And, if you are just starting with your investment journey I can understand how hard can it be to accumulate so much of money just to invest in one stock. And, even if you do what about the other stocks- how will you be able to diversify your portfolio?!

The answer - [M1 Finance](http://bit.ly/investM1Finance).

*Yes, M1 Finance is one of our affiliates. That means at no cost to you, we earn a commission if you sign up.*

### Free! Free! Free!

M1 Finance is a completely Free to use platform. They charge no commission to invest or to trade. This is wonderful, because a lot of platforms and investment advisors charge a heft fee which in long term eats into your profits and you don't even realize it.

*They just require a minimum deposit of $100 to start investing - to open an account.*

Well, if you don't have even a $100 I would recommend starting a savings goal right now. If you need help, I have gone in details on [how to create wealth and save yourself to be a Millionaire](http://ngninja.com/posts/build-wealth-with-no-money) I highly recommend you to read.


### Idealogy

M1 Finance encourages long term investment. It is not for someone who is into short-term or day trading. And, for the same reason they do not have any penny stocks for trading.

You can pick individual stocks and ETFs that you are interested in. M1 Finance also does not support Mutual Funds at this moment.

Now, let's dive deeper into how it works.
