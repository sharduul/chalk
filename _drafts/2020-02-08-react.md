## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.

React is a tool for building UI components(For front end).

## How does React Work?

React creates virtual DOM(Document Object Model) in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.

## Setting up a React Environment

If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the `create-react-app`.

Install `create-react-app` by running this command in your terminal
(in the folder where you want to save react app)

```
C:\Users\the folder you wish>npm install -g create-react-app
```

Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called firstreact

```
C:\Users\the folder you wish>npx `create-react-app` firstreact
```

The `create-react-app` will set up everything you need to run a React application.
 
## Running the react app

Run this command to move to the firstreact directory:

```
C:\Users\the folder you wish>cd myfirstreact
```

Run this command to run the React application firstreact:

```
C:\Users\the folder you wish\firstreact>npm start
```

A new default browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
(If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.) as shown in the picture below.

## Modifying the installed react application:

Letâ€™s Learn about major problem how to customize the react app.

Look in the firstreact directory, and you will find a src folder. Inside the src folder there is a file called App.js, open it and it will code like this:

```
/firstreact/src/App.js:
```

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Learn React
          </a>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Now,try changing the HTML content and save the file.
Changes are automatically reloaded into the browser.
Replace all the content inside the `<div className="App">` with a `<h1>` element.


```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

As Soon as you replace this code and save it the browser will look like


## React Components:

Components are like functions that return HTML elements via a render function.
Components are come in two types,Class Components and Function Components.

## Creating a Class Component:

The initial character of the class component must start with an uppercase letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

Create a Class component called `Ninja`

```
class Ninja extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, We learning React</h2>;
  }
}
```

## Creating a Function Component

Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves pretty much the same way as a Class component.

Create a Function component called `Ninja`

```
function Ninja() {
  return <h2>Hi, We are learning react</h2>;
}
```

## React JSX

This another most important topic of react.

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any `createElement()`  and `appendChild()` methods.

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

Let us demonstrate with two examples, the first uses JSX and the second does not have JSX anything to do:

### Example 1(Using JSX):

```
const myelement = <h1>We are learning React!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Example 2(Without Using JSX):

```
const myelement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'We are learning react');
ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In both the examples output is same i.e **We are learning react**.

In example 1, we passes HTML directly within the JavaScript code.
