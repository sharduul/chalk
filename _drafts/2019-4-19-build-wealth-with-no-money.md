- a lot of free advice out there
- but not everyone can benefit from them
- lot of loop holes

- advices like
  - 401k, compound interest, save 15% income, don't buy lattes
  - its BS

- it works.. but works slow..
- let me tell you how to do it fast..

- need to do what others are not doing
- get out of your comfort zone
- follow people who has achieved something in life

- you need money to make money
- you wanna make money fast? you need to invest more money
- traditional jobs aren't gonna cut it

- it is a mind shift
- putting more hours does not money you will make more money
- 9-5 job is old school thinking
- you are limited on time you have and time you can invest

- instead focus on adding value
- the results you bring in
- more value you add more money you can make... your income will be skyrocketed


- level up
- software engineer.... code 9-5.. same money... nothing more
- learn different skills
- like project management... security expert, AI expert
- get into sales
- achieve ultra level knowledge in some field
- become an authoritative entity


- switching job
- study shows switching job makes you more
- not switching jobs is bad
- study - "employees who stay in companies longer than 2 years get paid 50% less"
- move on quickly
- but not very fast... it can be a red flag
- I personally got 150% salary hike from my last job very recently...
  - put it in perspective 
  - if I had 100K salary 
  - now I have 250K salary


- start side hustle
- but the best way is to start your business
- find some gap, some problem out there
- make an app to fix it, start a blog to fix it, start youtube channel to help others
- this is what we did
- we saw there is a gap
- software engineers are bad a personal finances
- we are here to help them build wealth... create multiple streams of income
- we know all you guys will relate to it
- you might fail.. but that is okay
  - you will learn
  - everyone fails
  - but get up and trust us! you can make it


- invest in yourself
- do something, learn something
- keep following our blog for learning new regularly
- buy courses... doesn't have to be expensie
- could be FREE too... but don't stop learning
- youtube is your best buddy!


- saving money
- dollar saved is dollar earned
- housing, renting
  - find cheap house.. decent one.. not fancy
  - gym in the community
  - pool in community
  - don't have to go out to spend money to enjoy
- don't buy new car
  - 3-6 year car
  - it has done its depreciation
  - drive it until it does not drive anymore
- sleep before you buy
  - especially bigger purchases
  - it lets your subconscious mind decides whether you really want it
  - does it add value
  - some people go on for a month like this
  - if after a month you still think its beneficial... go buy it
- automate saving
  - pay yourself first
  - your paycheck should automatically go into investments account
  - best tools I recommend is Acorns and M1 finance
    - my reviews on both these tools are here
  - automate this part 
    - you will be amazed how after certain point you just don't realize how much money you saved without actually affecting your life
- track your spending
  - see where you spend the most
  - see what can you cut back on
  - you don't have to manually do it
  - my favorite tool
    - mint, personal capital
    - (add your ref links)
  - we all use it at ninja academy
  - helps us a lot to track our expenses


- invest your money
- think long term
- focus on passive income
- live on min possible
- do it for a while and boom! financial independence is just a piece of cake.. starting without having any money
- i know so many people who have done it

- conclusion
- take risk, level up, save money, invest money
- hustle, then hustle again
- don't give up
