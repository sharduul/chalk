If you have ever followed any of the typical personal finance blogs you might know have come across same style of free advice almost everywhere.

Advices like invest in 401K, compounding if your friend, save at least 10% of your income - these are floating all across the internet. And, although they are true these one-size-fits-all advices are not really useful for everyone. For one, it requires quite some time to see the results. Some of them even have loop holes.

Today we are going to teach how to build wealth faster. This article is a full-pack-set of complete actionable steps and a ton of examples to get your wealth-ball rolling.

### The Mind-shift

> >"Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time."
Jim Rohn

The above quote is super powerful if you think about it. The trick is to do what others are not doing. The key is to get out of your comfort zone. And, follow the people who has achieved something great in their life.

But, don't just stop there. Eventually you need to pump in some money to make money. If you are really serious of making money faster - you need to invest more money. Because trust me, traditional jobs aren't gonna make the cut.

It takes a complete mind shift to move away from the conventional thinking. Just putting more hours doest not mean you will make more money. The 9-5 job is the old school thinking.

### Adding Value

World is moving faster than you think. You shouldn't be limiting yourself to just investing time to make more money.

Instead, focus on adding value. Delivering huge results. Your rate is decided on the results you bring in. The more value you provide to your stakeholders - the more money you are going to make. And in no time, your income will be skyrocketed.

### Level Up

Let's talk about Software Engineers. There are a lot more Software Engineers than the actual demand. Well, you might say this is not true and companies are still complaining that they are struggling to find good engineers. But do note the keyword - "good engineers". 

Majority of Software Engineers today are not up to the par. They struggle to even find solutions to simple problems. They are just focusing on completing their 9-5 job and that is it!

If you are one of them - you are wasting your time. You will make the same money you are making today for the rest of your life.

You have to level up your game. Learn different skills. Sign up for new courses.

If you are a programmer - learn project management. Become cyber security expert. Get good at AI/Machine learning.

If you really want to get out of your comfort zone - get into sales. This is one field which will teach you all the valuable lessons which can sky rocket your career.

Whatever you choose - achieve ultra level knowledge in the field of your interest.


### Switch Job Faster

If you think your current job is not paying you as much as you would imagine - you are right. There are studies proving how bad not switching job is really.

> > "Employees who stay in companies longer than 2 years get paid 50% less."

This is so true. You need to be switching job faster than you think. Move on to the new adventure quicker. The salary bump you get by switching job is so much higher that you would super excited about your career and make your life financial stable earlier than you would think.

But beware, the job switches should not be too quickly. It can be a red flag on your resume.

I personally got 150% salary hike from my last job switch. Just to put it into perspective - I was making around 100K salary in my previous job. With this salary hike I am now making around 250K per year. 

I am not telling this to boast about me. I just want to change your mindset and make you realize the possibilities are endless. You just need to grab the opportunities.


### Start A Side Hustle

The above methods will surely get you started and put you on the right track. But, if you really want quicken the game of making the money - the best way is to start your business.

And the best way to go about it is - to find some gap, find some problem out there. And then create a solution to fix it. Make an app, start a blog, start a YouTube channel and provide knowledge. Choose your favorite platform - but add value to people and solve their problems. People are than willing to pay you handsome amount if you are genuinely helping them out.

This is exactly what we found out - at the Ninja Academy. This blog started out as a tech blog but now it has grow so much more than that. We realized Software Engineers are not so good at managing their personal finances. And that's the gap we are trying to fill in. 

We are here to help you guys build wealth. Create multiple streams of income. And we are sure you guys will enjoy and learn from our mistakes and the value bombs that we drop regularly.
