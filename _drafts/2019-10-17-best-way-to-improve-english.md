- people ask me all the time
  - how to improve communication skills
  - public speaking 
  - english

- i remember one incident 
- one best advice I ever got... this instantly improved my english 

- when I was in 8th grade... in school
- we had english teacher
- i struggling but trying..
- in those days english movies were getting popular in india 
  - titanic

- she told me to watch movies in subtitles
- stop watching movies only for the fun aspect
- there are so many things to learn from it 


- i did not do it at that time
- but it remained in my mind 
- when I got in college 
  - I got more freedom of watching movies... especiall english
  - so I kept watching them religiously... with subtitles 


- now things are so improved
- so when anyone asks me i tell them the same
- stop watching hindi soaps
- watch netflix, hbo, english series
- it will increase your vocab, your grammar
- it will tell you what to speak in which situations
- there are so many invaluable lessons 

- and then the missing piece
- practice practice and practice
- so obvious yet blatantly ignored
- you have to get comfortable of getting into uncomfortable situations
- grab every opportunity to speak in front of audience
- however big or small
- talk to a stranger everyday... on the bus, in the elavator... anywhere everywhere
- only practice will make you fluent in english
