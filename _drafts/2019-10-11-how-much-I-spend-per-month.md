- one of those person topics I am slowly opening up on.. coz a lot of you asked
- i created my passive income strategy <link here>... so everyone wants to know how much of that I spend
- it's not only that... this is packed with a lot of tips and tricks on budgeting, managing finances, frugality... what should you do what should you avoid


- first thing or let's say a tip
  - how much money I spend does not depend on how much I make
  - it is fixed... fixed for years
  - any salary hike I got, any passive income I created did not affect this at all
  - all the extra income I got is invested... not spent
  - it is in fact used to make more money for me
- it is a mentality shift  
  - yeah I talk about that a lot... but its true    
  - you really need to be mentally strong to not spend money that you have... and invest it instead 
  - no fancy stuff, no show-off
  - no branded clothes, shoes or watches
  - minimalist attitude

- > I love saving money... I am crazy passionate about that hobby of mine 

- let's dive in into the nitty gritty of my expenses
- everything... personal, business, donations
  - rent/mortgage
    - $0
    - in my [How to make passive income?](http://ngninja.com/posts/how-to-make-passive-income) post I mentioned about my rental property 
    - that rental property covers up for my mortgage completely
    - so no mortgage, no home insurace, and no home maintainence cost
    - this is called house hacking <link>
  - internet and utilities
    - 50 on internet
    - 150 on utilites... light, water, trash 
  - auto
    - $350
    - the amount is total of my car insurance, gas, and misc. expenses on maintenance
    - my car is completely paid off
    - my car insurance has a decent coverage... almost minimum required in Washington state..
      - tip#445 - that is the perk of owning a old car
    - i commute to work via public transport which my company pays for
    - car is old so she needs regular maintenance... but she's still strong like a hulk
  - health insurace
    - $0
    - my company covers my health insurace 100%... I don't have to pay anything
    - it also covers dental and vision insurance
    - plus there's life insurance as a benefit... so if anything ever happens to me while I work there my family will get $100K
  - gym and health
    - $150
    - 100 - gym
    - yeah I know this is a bit expensive
    - but it is worth it
    - this is through the gympass membership... my company pays for it
    - you know the best part? I can go to ANY gym around the world that is registered on the app... there are thousands of those
    - so I regularly do yogas, pilates, HIIT, crossfit, and so much more... you name it - I am sure I do it regularly
    - this expense is the reason I am amazingly fit amongst my group
    - 50 - protein and supplements
    - it is part of my health routine
    - keeps me fit 
  - phone
    - $35
    - and everything is unlimited
    - calls, data, hotspot
    - its a family plan 
  - groceries
    - 150
    - yeah I know you are shocked
    - but no - I don't just eat rice and beans
    - although nothing fancy, but I eat a healthy diet
    - i do meal prep... so shop in bulk
  - restaurants
    - 100
    - as mentioned I do cook in bulk
    - I don't like to eat outside much
    - that cuts down eat out expenses a looot
    - this also keeps me health and fit
  - vacation
    - 300
    - budgeted that much each month
    - that doesn't mean I go on vacation each month
    - it just gets added up that I use for the big vacations
    - I usually do 2-4 such big vacations each year
    - I am planning to visit Maldives <trip advisor link> next year 
    - any recommendations for me?
  - misc
    - 200
    - movies, parlor, fun shopping, tech gadgets
    - big fan of tech gadgets - apple fan, google fan
    - planning to buy the new apple watch
    - but I am still using my iphone 6s which I bought 4 years back
    - so I know how to maintain a balance of saving and spending on my passion for tech gadgets
    - i need to go to parlor because I am a tech entrepreneur so I have to meet clients so I need to look decent :)


- spend approx only $1500 each month
- i understand that is super low for some of you
- but the trick is to cut down on personal expenses and go all in on expenses that will make you more money

- this is not constant each month
- I am a human being too
- I feeling like going on a extra vacation... eat in a fancy restaurant once in a while... 
- but I am allowed to do that because I deserve to pamper myself sometimes..
- this is the whole idea about a FI-life... financial independent life
- you cut down on unnecessary expenses... and go all in on things that you value the most...


- this also means stress free life
- I have less expenses... so less things to worry about and enjoy the little things to the fullest
- this is the minimalist mindset I preach about all the time
 
- conclusion
  - so this is how much I spend and what I spent money on
  - keep in mind your expenses should not depend on how much money you make... it should only depend on what things you value the most in your life
  - just invest the remainder
  - put your finances on auto pilot
