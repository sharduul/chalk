This is not usual to me. I am the most shy person in any room that you see me in. But, this is slowly becoming one of those topics I am slowly opening up on. Mostly, because a lot of you have been asking me about it.

<!-- <internal link here> -->
Very recently, I declared my passive income strategy - you can read about it here.  And now, everyone wants to kow how much of that I actually spend.

This post is going to reveal my darkest secrets and guilty pleasures. More importantly, this post is much more than that - it is packed with a lot of tips and tricks on budgeting, managing finances, and frugality. So don't miss a single line below this one.

### Tip # Zero

First things first. How much money I spend does not depend on how much money I make. It has been and will be fixed for years. And, I strive really hard to keep it that way.

So, any salary hike I get or any passive income stream I create does not affect my spending habits. All the extra income that I get is invested. 

> The extra money I make is not spent. It is in fact used to make me more money.

### The Mentality Shift

I have talked about this a lot in the past. 

You really need to be mentally strong to be able to control your mind to not spend money that you have. And invest it instead.

Strive hard to not buy fancy stuff just to show-off. So, no branded clothes, watches, or iPhones. 

> I love saving money... I am crazy passionate about that hobby of mine 

Let's dive into the nitty gritty of my expenses.

### Rent/Mortgage - $0

Yes, I spend $0 on my mortgage.

In my [How to make passive income?](http://ngninja.com/posts/how-to-make-passive-income) post I mentioned about the rental property. That rental property covers up for my mortgage completely.

So no mortgage, no home insurance, and no home maintenance cost.

This is called house hacking. I can make a new post if you are interested to learn more about it.

### Internet and Utilities - $200

This is pretty basic. I spend $40 and internet and $160 on average on utilities. This covers water, sewage, trash, and electricity.

### Auto - $350

I spend a total of $350 on my auto expenses. This includes my car insurance, gas, and any miscellaneous expenses.

My car is completely paid off. My insurance has a decent coverage. Almost the minimum required in Washington state.

#### Tip #445 - that is the perk fof owning an old car.

I commute to work via public transport which my company pays for. So, my gas expenses are close to bare minimum. My car is 10 years old - so yes, she needs regular maintenance. But, she's still strong like a lady-hulk!
