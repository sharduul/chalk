This article describes the difference between leading market pro-players Flutter & React.

First we discuss the pros and cons of an flutter and later we move to react part.

## Flutter

- A portable UI toolkit for building natively-compiled apps across desktop, mobile, and web* from a unique platform.

- Flutter enables cross-platform app development.

- Programming language used in Flutter is [Dart](https://dart.dev/).

- Flutter apps look as good on the up-to-date operating systems as they do on older versions.

- Flutter is created by Google and officially released on May 2017.

- Flutter supports Hot reload.

### What is hot reload?

The idea behind hot reloading is to keep the app running and to inject new versions of the files that you edited at runtime. This way, you don't lose any of your state which is especially useful if you are tweaking the UI.

- If you have the same code for multiple platforms then your QA time and efforts will get cut down by 50% as you just need to test only in one codebase.

- The Flutter framework offers widgets, which are capable of developing customizable specific designs. Most importantly, Flutter has two sets of widgets: Material Design and Cupertino widgets that help to provide a glitch-free experience on all platforms.

- Flutter uses Business Logic Component [(BLoC)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13213_01/wlevs/docs30/create_apps/pojo.html) architecture.

- Flutter is free and open-source framework for building mobile apps.

- When compared to react it has a less community support.

- Dart is not being a regular language in terms of usage, there is a distinct lack of support in many IDEs and text editors.

- React is free and open-source.

- React is mainly focused on UI.

- React makes the app interface highly responsive.

- Third party libraries are supported by react to make app interactive.

- React supports Hot reload.

- React used to develop the code on both android and ios.

- The code written in React is compiled into native code, which enables it for all operating systems to provide closer native appearance and functions in the same way on all platforms.

- React uses Flux and Redux architecture. Flux created by Facebook, whereas Redux is the preferred choice among the community.

- It has very strong community support where the questions and issues can be solved quickly.

- React is created by facebook and officially released on June 2015.

- All IDEs support JavaScript so there will never be a problem regarding usage according to the developer which gives a great amount of liberty to every developer involved.
