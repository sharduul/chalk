Beginning development in vscode? Switching to VScode? Save the nostalgia and the lost feeling. These extensions are here to save the day and possibly a lot more days before deadline



## 1. Prettier


It claims to be *opinionated code formatter*. Let me break it down ever had a team project where everything was fine but there was some problem reading the code after compiling all codes because of different formatting *haha next time please use formatting*. So how prettier help you? It does the task of formatting and it is completely automatic.

To install Prettier

In VS code enter
>CTRL+P

Then type-
>ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode

[**OR install Prettier from VS marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

There are two ways to use prettier

1. It is set by default to auto-format

OR

2. Open settings.json and add the following lines

> // Set the default
"editor.formatOnSave": false,
// Enable per-language
"[javascript]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}

## 2. Live Server

The most frequent thing done by a developer is opening a browser and reloading the webpages repeatedly to see the changes made by their code and a server to test their website. This extension covers both the problems. It has an auto-reload feature and a server to test your website. It also allows you to have a customizable port number, server root, default browse, preferable hostname, https support and a lot of extra features. You must be thinking an extension having all these features must be complicated to use? Not at all. All these happen just with the push of a button.

Just press this button(if you have the Html file)

## 3. Gitlens

Lets go to the team project again. To understand why and what someone did some changes to code is a lot of hassle. That is where gitlens comes into play. You must be having questions, *" why use gitlens while VS Code already has GIT capabilities built-in?"* GitLens improves the functionality of Git, which is integrated into Visual Studio code. It helps you identify the authorship of the code at a glance through annotations and Git code targets, navigate smoothly and explore the Git repositories, and get valuable information thanks to powerful comparison commands.
