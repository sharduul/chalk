### My Journey - Generating Passive Income
- I am a software engineer by profession 
- but I always wanted to do more than that 
- I originally started with blogging about tech
  - angularjs, javascript, web apps development
  - getting 4000 organic views each month
- got into bitcoin and crypto currency just before the boom in 2017
  - just about the perfect time!
  - portfolio is doing good but I don't invest in it as regularly now
- started watching videos on generating passive income, affiliate marketing, managing personal finance
- slowly I started getting knowledge and experience in each of them

> First step is to JUST Start. And not worry about anything else. Just start something!

Internet is free, so use it to your advantage. Blog. Create Instagram account, or a Facebook group. Create YouTube videos if you are good in front of camera. Pick your favorite platform and just start creating content on regular basis.



### Generate Passive Income With NO Money Required
- internet is your friend... 
- study the field you love the most... 
- get real experience in it... and just blog your self doing it...
- blog about your experiences, your learnings... 
- keep creating content and give a personal touch to it ... 
- don't worry about the money ... 
- it is a marathon... 
- for first 6 months just create great content...




> Generating passive income is a marathon. For the first 6 months just create valuable content and help your audience. Money will start rolling.

One thing I have learned in my journey is to never give up. For many years initially I had nothing. I wasn't making any money. But, eventually everything just fell into place - because of my hard work. 



### Is instagram great source of income?
- oh yes! I do it 
- that is a great source of income 
- but please note - there is no organic growth
- Instagram has become stricter now
- so, if you are not afraid to show your face, I would suggest give a shot to TikTok!




### Don't Fear Competition
- competition is good dear 
- it means there is a lot of demand
- embrace it, use it to your advantage
- create something unique, stand apart from the crowd




- side income is a game 
- you mix and match multiple things together 
- you re-purpose your content 
- all creative things happen when you mix multiple things together
