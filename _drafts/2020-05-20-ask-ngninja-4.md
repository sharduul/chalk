## How to get job at Google without a degree?

Is it possible to get a job at top tier company without a degree?

Yes and no - the thing is you should have done something worth while to be considered for the job interview

If not a degree - something equivalent to it... like some awesome open source project contribution, or some startup of your own, or some research paper published

You can also go the Bootcamp route - they are pretty famous for getting hired in top tier tech companies!
