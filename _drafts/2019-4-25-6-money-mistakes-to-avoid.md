- biggest money mistakes to avoid
- some even I have made... I will share my experience

- subscribe below if you like

- especially young people


1. avoiding 401k
- no idea what it is, how it works
- school does not teach it
- if you know and still don't contribute... that is the biggest mistake
- start with small amount at least
- 51% millenials not contributing!!! blows my mind
- no way you can retire
- you will wonder why i don't have money
- you will have to work forever
- compound interest is important
- give money time to grow
- ex: invest $100 per month... from 20 to 60 years... you will have ~$350K at 60... @ 8%PA
- but if you start few years later like at 30... you will have just ~$150K at 60...
- see the difference?
- that is the power of compounding
- time is verryyy imp!
- start 401k now!!!
- great if employer is matching... at least up to the match - that is FREE money


2. buying new car
- done it myself... my friends still do it
- bought flash dodge charger
- no need of it in the first place
- overpaid the price
- was paying heft interest on loan
- some of my friends are still paying off their mercedes and bmw's... don't do that mistake
- you can in fact invest that same amount and create wealth in the long term
- if you want to start with your investment career
  - checkout acorns and m1 finance reviews here <add links!!!>
- they are a liability
- they are depcreciating assets... you don't want that
- you want to invest in appreciating assets
- i learnt lesson early
- i bought a used toyota 2010... works great! already paid off in less than 2 years
- so how much should you be spending
  - between 6%-8% of your monthly income
  - definitely not above 10% of your monthly income


3. student loans
- quote- college/schools is the biggest modern age scams
- annual fees are increasing exponentially each year
- college is not bad though
- i did it, I am a masters student in computer science
- but you need to be mindful
- you don't have to go to the top college
- even community colleges are great
  - i know many friends form community college that have made it big
- second mistake is getting a degree which does not have scope that creates wealth
  - of that can help you create wealth at least
- getting into debt for a degree that is useless
- some skills don't even require degree
  - take some courses
  - learn from a mentor
- now a days even google and microsoft are hiring without a degree
  - you just need to be good at something
- so many online resources\


4. find something!!!


5. find something!!!


6. avoiding risks - #myStory
- might sounds philosophical
- but this is the biggest one of all
  - not following the gut
- my story
  - i was comfy with my job
  - earning avg salary 70k.. living nicely.. ok ok benefits
  - i always wanted to earn 6 digit figure... but was too lazy.. not doing anything about it
  - my friends all got great job
  - one day I quit my job.. frustated... getting out of comfort zone.. burning bridges
    - went all in
    - took leap of faith
  - i took time off, 3 months.. prepared myself for interviews, working my ass off
  - all this with no income at that point
  - responsibility of paretns
  - but I had confidence in me
  - and I cracked it... now i earn $250K salary per anum
  - more than all of my friends who started together with me
- do not be afraid... 
- quote: donot avoid risk... it might just make you a millionaire
