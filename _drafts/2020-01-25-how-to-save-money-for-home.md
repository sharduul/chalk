- always asked tips for saving for house
- how to save cash
- get minimum mortgage
- should we also save for retirement while doing that

- let's go back to the basics
- you need enough money
- what lenders look for?


- i always ask
- how old
- debt free?
- emergency fund?
- how much down payment you are planning?
- budget?
- how many year plan

- if not saving for retirement while saving for house
  - don't go beyond 5 years savings
  - depending on how much down you plan to put
- i have known many couples pay full cash


- lender requirements
- good credit score more than 700-750 for sure and better rates
- tax returns mostly 2 years
- bank statements - 3 to 6 months
- cash reserves - 2 - 4 months of mortgage + interest + taxes
  - they usually consider retirement accounts
- might defer per state but these are most common docs
- these are minimum but not an exhaustive list


- down payment
- i suggest 15%-20%
- else you will pay PMI for less than 20%
  - private mortgage insurance
  - insure the bank because you paid less money
- some even pay less than 10% or even 0% down
  - check the interest rate that you get
  - hard to get approved for mortgage
