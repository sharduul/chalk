* not a clickbait..
    * this article will actually give you actionable steps
* sarcasm: so many great things I learned in school
    * pythagoras
    * calculas
* my favorite was how to be Millnr... which actually never happened!
* 99% taught in school is useless
* today I will teach you!

how not to become it

* buying useless things
* putting cash away under your bed
    * it will lose its money because of inflation
* putting money in bank and hoping that would happen
    * bad interest

how to beome one?

* one word - compound interest!
* buy stuff as you usually do
    * save the change everytime you buy something...
    * lets say you buy coffee each day 
        * it costs you $3.29
        * change is $0.71
        * you save it everyday
        * month end ~$20
    * lets turn it up a notch
        * lets 3x the savings rate... because you really do care about your finances
        * and plus 3 times some change isn't really that much if you think so..
        * so you save 3 X $0.71 for 30 days
        * month end ~$60!
* guess what you don't live on just coffee!
    * you buy groceries, you buy tech, you buy so many things in day to day life
    * imagine how much would you save each month by just making regular purchases and saving the change to round the dollar for every purchase
* sounds good isnit it
    * lets say you save $100 each month by not doing anything... but making regular purchases and saving the change
    * don't put it in the bank!
    * you need to invest it in companies - buying stocks, bonds and ETFs
        * to get amazing returns on your investment
* but wait a minute
    * how do you save it
    * would you manually invest change for every purchase?
    * thats what stone age people did!... but not you
    * there is amazing tool which automates this whole process for you - Acorns
* acorns
    * small intro
    * tell some nice pros
    * costs only $1 per month
    * it lets you compound
    * select how aggressive you want
    * for younger people.. go full aggressive... that is what I do..
    * I have been getting 12% at least anual returns on my money... it is more than than usually... but lets go ahead with 12%
* after 50 years
    * it sounds long.. but lets just go with it and see how we can reduce it
    * compound magic
    * portfolio value is now $1M... calculate the amount here
    * you just became M ... by just investing some change each day!
    * but wait a minute... you are gonna work.. you are gonna make more money... you are gonna receive raise..
    * why not invest more than just a change
    * what if you invest $250 per month
    * what if $500
    * what if $1000
* you get the point right
* what is stopping you to get started today??
* sign up for acorns
    * it is just $1 per month... 
    * but it is perfect automating tool for beginer investors
    * lets you be disciplined spendor..
