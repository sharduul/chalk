### My Affiliate Marketing Strategy
- find your niche, passion 
- search the affiliate partners/products to promote
- study their products, use them if you can 
- create amazing blog around it 
- write 10-20 highly keyword focussed articles 
- provide amazing value to your users in your niche
- once you start generating traffic, pitch in your affiliate links through your blog
- tell them how that product will change their life for good



### Which is better vs Affiliate marketing?
- why not both?
- start with blogging 
- create good content 
- and then pitch your affiliate links There 
- best bloggers in the world do the same 




### My Journey - Generating Passive Income
- I am a software engineer by profession 
- but I always wanted to do more than that 
- I originally started with blogging about tech
- now I blog on personal finance management too (ngninja.com) 
- meanwhile I created the Instagram account 
- giving away tips and tricks
- sharing FREE courses
- Ranjana Banerjee is becoming a brand slowly





### Best Dividend Stocks To Buy
 - I live in USA 
 - so I cannot pin point stocks in India or any other country in particular
 - in general keep in mind invest in stocks of companies you use daily! 
 - like internet, utility company, toothpaste, oil companies
 - they will stay around for decades at least 
 - these category of companies pay out regular dividends
 - my top 3 pick - ATTnT, Walmart, Exxon Mobil



> First step is to JUST Start. And not worry about anything else. Just start something!

Internet is free, so use it to your advantage. Blog. Create Instagram account, or a Facebook group. Create YouTube videos if you are good in front of camera. Pick your favorite platform and just start creating content on regular basis.



### Generate Passive Income With NO Money Required
- this is very much doable... 
- internet is your friend... 
- study the field you love the most... 
- get real experience in it... and just blog your self doing it...
- blog about your experiences, your learnings... 
- keep creating content and give a personal touch to it ... 
- don't worry about the money ... 
- it is a marathon... 
- for first 6 months just create great content...

> Generating passive income is a marathon. For the first 6 months just create valuable content and help your audience. Money will start rolling.

One thing I have learned in my journey is to never give up. For many years initially I had nothing. I wasn't making any money. But, eventually everything just fell into place - because of my hard work. 



### Is instagram great source of income?
- oh yes! I do it 
- that is a great source of income 
- but please note - there is no organic growth
- Instagram has become stricter now
- so, if you are not afraid to show your face, I would suggest give a shot to TikTok!




### Don't Fear Competition
- competition is good dear 
- it means there is a lot of demand
- embrace it, use it to your advantage
- create something unique, stand apart from the crowd




- side income is a game 
- you mix and match multiple things together 
- you re-purpose your content 
- all creative things happen when you mix multiple things together
