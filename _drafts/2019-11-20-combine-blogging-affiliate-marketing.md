### My Affiliate Marketing Strategy
- what is it - in short.....
- can start with zero investment
- find your niche, passion 
- search the affiliate partners/products to promote
- study their products, use them if you can 
  - better understanding of how to promote them, connect to your users
  - speak your audience language
- create amazing blog around it 
  - use wordpress.org, or jekyll-github if you are good with programming
- write 10-20 highly keyword focussed articles 
  - it has to be natural tho
- provide amazing value to your users in your niche
- once you start generating traffic, pitch in your affiliate links through your blog
- tell them how that product will change their life for good
- some ever green niches are health, personal finance, relationship, home decor
  - others work too.. but you have to work hard to get good customers



### Which is better vs Affiliate marketing?
- frequent question
- why not both?
  - in fact the combination works wonderful
- start with blogging 
  - pick your passion, study it, gain immense experience in it 
  - fail often to get the experience
- create 10-20 good valuable posts in the niche
- then slowly pitch your affiliate links there 
- best bloggers in the world do the same 
- this way you can create your own digital products too
  - and promote them... earn 100% of the profit for yourself! imagine that
- keep in mind you deserve to financially independent... you deserve a successful life!




### Best Dividend Stocks To Buy
 - I live in USA 
 - so I cannot pin point stocks in India or any other country in particular
 - in general keep in mind invest in stocks of companies you use daily! 
 - like internet, utility company, toothpaste, oil companies
 - they will stay around for decades at least 
 - these category of companies pay out regular dividends
 - my top 3 pick - ATTnT, Walmart, Exxon Mobil


> Generating passive income is a marathon. For the first 6 months just create valuable content and help your audience. Money will start rolling.

One thing I have learned in my journey is to never give up. For many years initially I had nothing. I wasn't making any money. But, eventually everything just fell into place - because of my hard work. 



### Don't Fear Competition
- competition is good dear 
- it means there is a lot of demand
- embrace it, use it to your advantage
- create something unique, stand apart from the crowd




- side income is a game 
- you mix and match multiple things together 
- you re-purpose your content 
- all creative things happen when you mix multiple things together
