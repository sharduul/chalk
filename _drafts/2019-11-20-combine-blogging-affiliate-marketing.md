Ok so for affiliate this should be your strategy 
- find your niche, passion 
- search the affiliate partners 
- study their products, use them if you can 
- create amazing blog on it 
- write 10-20 high keyword focussed articles 
- provide amazing value to your users 
- once you start generating traffic, pitch in your affiliate links through your blog


my journey 
- I am a software engineer by profession 
- but I always wanted to do more than that 
- I originally started with blogging about tech
- and now I blog on personal finance too ... 
- meanwhile I created the Instagram account ... 
- where I daily add value to my users 
- I also share FREE tech courses to help my students



 I live in USA 
 - so I cannot pin point stocks in India ...
 - but do keep in mind invest in stocks of companies you use daily ... 
 - like internet, washing powder, toothpaste, oil companies...
 - they will stay around for a good while... 
 - and give you a lot of dividends..



first step is to JUST Start 
and not worry about anything else ....

just start something!!

blog.. create IG account... create FB groups... create Youtube videos



no investment passive income....
- this is very much doable... 
- internet is your friend... 
- study the field you love the most... 
- get real experience in it... and just blog your self... 
- blog about your experiences, your learnings... 
- just create content and give a personal touch to it ... 
- don't worry about the money ... 
- it is a marathon... 
- for first 6 months just create great content...


affiliate marketing I do using blog and Instagram...
then I have partnered with some of my friends who create youtube content... so we do youtube together


one trick is to never give up... like I always say - it is marathon ... keep giving values to other people... they will eventually pay you for premium services...


tech as programming... just create blog or videos explaining the latest programming frameworks... reactjs, machine learning, these are boooooming!


I fear competition 

- competition is good dear 
- it means there is a lot of demand
- embrace it, use it to your advantage


Which is best blogging vs affiliate marketing?

- why not both?
- start with blogging 
- create good content 
- and then pitch your affiliate links There 
- best bloggers in the world do the same 




- side income is a game 
- you mix and match multiple things together 
- you re-purpose your content 
- all creative things happen when you mix multiple things together 


Is instagram great source of income?

- oh yes!
- I do it 
- that is a great source of income 
- but if you are not afraid to show your face, I would suggest give a shot to tictoc!
