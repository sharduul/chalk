  <h1>About Ninja Academy</h1>
  <p>
    I am in love with
    <a href="/tag/javascript/" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and passionate
    about web applications development. Currently, I am on a mission to share
    anything and everything I have learned related to web development
    technologies and make them super fun to use for my developer-mates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along with vanilla
    <a href="/tag/javascript/" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, technologies
    that excites me are
    <a href="/tag/angularjs/" title="AngularJS">AngularJS</a>,
    <a href="/tag/angular2/" title="Angular 4">Angular 4</a>,
    <a href="/tag/reactjs/" title="About me">ReactJS</a>, Ionic, Ionic 2,
    NodeJS, HTML5, CSS. (I shall update this list as I experiment with the new
    ones).
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently I am hacking on some applications which uses latest web frameworks
    like <a href="/tag/angular2/" title="Angular 4">Angular 4</a> and Ionic 2. I
    also like to automate things using open source tools and languages. You can
    expect articles on this theme very soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in the notion that to completely understand any concept you should
    be able to explain it to others in simplest possible way. And that is the
    whole purpose of this blog. My aim is to share all the lessons, concepts and
    techniques I have learned in simplest possible way with everyone who is just
    as passionate about web technologies as I am. Each article on this blog will
    be short and crisp, explaining a single concept in depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    My philosophy to completely understand any technical concept is to ask these
    4 simple questions:<br /><br />
    1. <a href="/tag/the-what-series/" title="NgNinja">What?</a> (What are
    <a href="/tag/javascript/" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
    closures?)<br />
    2. Why? (Why are they so important?)<br />
    3. <a href="/tag/the-how-series/" title="NgNinja">How?</a> (How do I use
    them?)<br />
    4. When? (When should I use them?)<br />
