Last few weeks I was travelling to my home country - India. For a very important (secret) mission. While travelling I came across some real cool articles and discoveries that I wante to share with you guys.

### 1. [2017 JavaScript conferences](https://blog.hellojs.org/2017-javascript-conferences-6cf6ef948570#.i88ugk9pd)
If you are JavaScript fanatic like me, then here's a list of JavaScript conference you could attend in 2017. Get inspired by some cool people and build something awesome.

### 2. [New Raspberry Pi Zero comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/new-10-raspberry-pi-zero-comes-with-wi-fi-and-bluetooth/)
My resolution for year 2017 is to explore Raspberry Pi and build something cool with it. Well, they just announced a new version with Wifi and Bluetooth inbuilt in it. Check it out and let me know what cool things you are planning to build using it.


### 3. [First SHA1 Collision](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav
)
They are right when they say nothing is truly secure. SHA-1 algorithm which was considered so fool proof has recently been compromised. Google just announced a practical technique for generating a collision in SHA-1 hash function.


### 4. [New planets discovered](http://www.nature.com/news/these-seven-alien-worlds-could-help-explain-how-planets-form-1.21512?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews&utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)
Meeting your alien fantasies has just come closer to reality. NASA has discovered new earth sized planet very close to earth. Check out the link in title for full description.


### Summary:
Some really cool things were discoverd while I was on a vacation. Stay put for more such awesome discoveries in my future curated lists.
