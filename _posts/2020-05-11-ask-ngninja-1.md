## I'm more like backend dev back then. I am planning to learn a JavaScript framework. So should I stick with vanilla js or typescript??

Excellent question. 

JavaScript language is getting more popular by the day as the world is moving on to the browsers and mobile.

If you want to succeed as a JavaScript developer, I highly highly recommend you to get your vanilla fundamentals super clear.

JavaScript language is notorious in that it is so easy to just start using it and creating stuff with it - but, it's a little tricky to use it correctly.


So, it's very important you know the concepts like how "this" works in JavaScript, or what are closures, why is hoisting important. The list is long.

Once you know the fundamentals of vanilla javascript, then I would encourage you to learn the importance of types in JavaScript applications. You wouldn't be able to justify the importance of TypeScript if you are not sure why you need them in the first place.

And, then when you have enough understanding about all the above - you should take up a JS framework and start building applications. You can start with React, Angular, Vue - these all are really good.

In today's world, I believe being a full-stack developer pays off a lot more. I can go into the details about this in the future. But, don't stop working on backend technologies while you are learning JavaScript.

## I am a student. I need a job and earn some money. Where do I start?

I am so glad you are thinking about your future at this young age. Kudos to you! I would do this. 

Be a rockstar student in your college, in your field. Put in all the hard work towards getting that degree. If you are paying for the tuition your first responsibility is to do justice to it. Because education is expensive.

Now to the most interesting part.

If you think are you are doing more than enough for your college degree start learning extra skills outside of your classroom. Take up courses that would teach your the income earning skills. Like freelancing, writing, video editing, photography.

If you are a programmer you are already in a good place to start any side hustle you'd like.

An example path for you in today's market - I would encourage you to start blogging about your favorite programming language. Start a twitter account and just give out amazing tips and tricks and lessons on coding. Then create a 7-day or 14-day FREE course for beginners to level up their programming skills. And at the end of the course sell an eBook that goes into much details and more actionable steps that your students can benefit from.

To be honest, the options are limitless. It all depends on your creativity.
