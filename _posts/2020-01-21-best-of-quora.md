I love to read question and answers a lot on Quora. I spend half my time perusing content on that platform - sometimes for fun, a lot of times to get better insights on my life.

Here's a curated list of all the questions that I have found fascinating. I will update this list of questions as I come across more amazing ones.

### Q: [My boyfriend bought me a very expensive gift, but I was planning to dump him. How do I deal with this situation?](https://qr.ae/TJ6EyF)
