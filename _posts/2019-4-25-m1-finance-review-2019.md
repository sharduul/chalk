This post is dedicated to the best free investing app out there - M1 Finance. I will provide a super comprehensive review on the platform and help you decide whether or not this app is for you.

It is the most frequently asked review on this blog and on our investment channel<insta link to ninja>.

### The Best One Out There

Right off the bat, M1 Finance is super charged with a lot of features. It is better than any other similar apps out there. (ahem, Robinhood).

M1 Finance lets you invest in partial shares of individual stocks and ETFs. Let's be honest, not everyone has money to buy full stock of Amazon and Google. You need to a have ton of money to buy the whole stock.

And, if you are just starting with your investment journey I can understand how hard can it be to accumulate so much of money just to invest in one stock. And, even if you do what about the other stocks- how will you be able to diversify your portfolio?!

The answer - [M1 Finance](http://bit.ly/investM1Finance).

_Yes, M1 Finance is one of our affiliates. That means at no cost to you, we earn a commission if you sign up._

### Free! Free! Free!

M1 Finance is a completely Free to use platform. They charge no commission to invest or to trade. This is wonderful, because a lot of platforms and investment advisors charge a heft fee which in long term eats into your profits and you don't even realize it.

_They just require a minimum deposit of \$100 to start investing - to open an account._

Well, if you don't have even a \$100 I would recommend starting a savings goal right now. If you need help, I have gone in details on [how to create wealth and save yourself to be a Millionaire](http://ngninja.com/posts/build-wealth-with-no-money) I highly recommend you to read.

### Idealogy

M1 Finance encourages long term investment. It is not for someone who is into short-term or day trading. And, for the same reason they do not have any penny stocks for trading.

You can pick individual stocks and ETFs that you are interested in. M1 Finance also does not support Mutual Funds at this moment.

Now, let's dive deeper into how it works.

### Account Types

There are different options you can select from while opening account on M1 Finance. You can choose them based on your financial goal.

#### Individual Account

This is a regular account. If you are not sure what you want to open, go for this one. You can take out funds whenever you want. Just don't forget to file taxes on your trades.

#### Joint Account

Very similar to the individual account - you can open a joint account with someone you trust.

#### Retirement Account

This is just as it sounds. If your financial goal is to save for the retirement - open an Retirement Account. The minimum deposit you need is \$500 for such an account.

#### Rollover Your Previous 401K

If you had a 401K with your previous employer you can roll it over to M1 Finance. This is especially recommended if your previous provider is charging you hefty fees.

### Pie

M1 Finance has a unique way setting up your portfolios. When you open your M1 Finance account the first thing you will notice is the [pie investing](https://www.m1finance.com/how-it-works/invest/pies/).

<add image here>

If you notice, they look a exactly like a pie chart. The pies become the basis of your investment and shows the distribution of your assets into various funds you chose.

You can create custom pies and have a full control over them. Meaning you can diversify them as you want.

A portfolio is made up of one or more pies. And each pie can include individual funds or another level of pie altogether.

### Reading The Pie

As mentioned above - your portfolio looks a lot like a pie chart. Such a pie char shows the holding percentage of all your funds.

So, for example you can dedicate 20% of the pie to Amazon stock, and 15% of the pie to the Tesla stock. And so on.

You can click each part of the pie which will highlight the fund on the list. You can then view the actual amount invested and the profits earned by that fund.

To view more details of the fund - you can click the fund on your list. It will show you the fraction amount of shares bought, the total amount invested in that share, how is share performing in the market, more news about the share to keep you updated on that, total dividends earned on that share, and much more.

You can adjust your portfolio anytime and any number of times you want. It is completely free to do so!

### Automated Re-balancing

When you add funds to M1 Finance, it automates it based on your percentages. Basically you have to assign percentage of your pie to all the funds that you want to add. Then M1 Finance re-balances your portfolio to balance your deposit as per their percentage value.

Additionally if some stock is already overweight it will balance it out and add more stocks which is a little underweight in your portfolio.

While selling, it does the reverse. It sells from the stock which are overweight first rather than the underweight stocks.

This is all automated and you don't have to worry about it.

### Expert Advice

One of the best unique selling points of M1 Finance is the expert pies. If you are not much of an active investor or if you are just starting and have a limited knowledge - this is your best friend.

We will write more details on it in future blog. But, basically it offers you well researched pies with with potential of maximum returns. The pies contain well diversified funds and a wide range of choice you can choose from based on your financial goal.

But, we recommend you getting your feet wet and discover the great funds you want to invest in for yourself. M1 Finance offers a great discovery tool you can use to search stocks and ETFs to invest in.

You can study the stock, check out their performance. Look at their market performance on 1-day, 1-year, 3-years, 5-years chart.

They also offer a brief profile on any particular company you want. So, you can checkout the latest news about the company and see if the company is worth investing in for the long term.

You can filter by any sector you love. May it be technology, real estate, or any other. Or search by company names like Facebook, Google, Tesla, and so on.

You can get the latest updates on the companies and you can also compare your index with Dow Jones and S&P to see how your portfolio is doing compared to the market.

### Pros and Cons
