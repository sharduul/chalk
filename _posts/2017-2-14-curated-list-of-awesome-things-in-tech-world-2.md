This week I have been busy with a lot of office work. Our app was about to go live and we had a load of backlog to complete. But yay! Everything is buttoned up and good to go.

So, while I was at it I came across couple of really cool things I wanted to share with you guys.

### 1. Trying to fix bugs in production
This one cracks me up every single time.

### 2. [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
This has to be the first thing on the list. In short, "Curse of knowledge" is when you know a lot of knowledge in certain subject and you are trying to explain someone about something related to it- assuming they have as much knowledge in it as you do.

Basically, it happens when you try to show off like an expert to someone who is still amateur in that subject. I had recently come across such phenomenon with my designer fellows when trying to explain them some things related to HTML and CSS. Now, next time I will have a phrase for it!


### 3. [What's new in Chrome 56](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/01/nic56?utm_source=frontendfocus&utm_medium=email)
If you are a web developer, there's a lot of good news for you guys. New Chrome updates will make your life real easy. It's all about HTML5, new CSS properties, Web Bluetooth API, and much more.


### 4. [Angular Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
If you come from the days when Bootstrap was a real hot concept, you might find this one awesome too. We all know that, these days, everyone is talking about Angular, Angular2 and other cool UI frameworks. If you are using Angular in your project you can check out this official Bootstrap library which can be integrated with Angular out-of-the-box.


### Summary:
Please let me know what do you think of this list of awesome things I discovered in this week. Also, please do let me know if there is anything else that you came across and you want to share it with me.
